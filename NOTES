• Developed CLI built on Sinatra which retrieves upcoming match information for international rugby matches.
• Scraped Wales Rugby Union website for relevant data using Nokogiri gem.



In terminal type
bundle gem name_of_project
this will create the folder structure you want

You want to start your programming with a shell of what the cli should do (with out the smarts in the background) then you can refine the scraping and advanced methods in the background


The Bin exeucatble file needs the below line of code so that the program knows to read the code as ruby
        #!/usr/bin/env ruby
        this is located in wru/bin/console

the bin folder should contain an executable file that the user essentially interracts with
you can lookup the file permissions of the files in the folder by typing below into editor as long as the terminal is on that folder:
        ls -lah
        #more permissions
        https://support.rackspace.com/how-to/checking-linux-file-permissions-with-ls/

when you review the permissions :
        r = read
        w = write
        x - execuctable

if your executable file does not contain x, then it is more difficult for the user to directly call the program from the cli prompt
to give executabel permission to the file you must type the following in terminal:
        chmod +x daily-deal
        #above daily-deal is the name of the executable file
        # after the change you can now execute the file by typing the below text directly into terminal:
            ./bin/daily-deal
        #this teaches our operating system how to interpeate ruby (using the shabing header line)

setup the bones - methods call, list, menu, goodby
--------------------------------
then setup the higher thinking of your code
-----------
when running in terminal  ./bin/console for first time after setting up the deal.rb (under lib folder and daily_deal folder) i received the following error
              Bundler could not find compatible versions for gem "bundler":
                In Gemfile:
                  bundler (~> 1.15)

                Current Bundler version:
                  bundler (1.11.2)
              This Gemfile requires a different version of Bundler.
              Perhaps you need to update Bundler by running `gem install bundler`?

              Could not find gem 'bundler (~> 1.15)' in any of the sources
To fix this i had to open the daily_deal.gemspec file and change
                spec.add_development_dependency "bundler", "~> 1.15"
to
                spec.add_development_dependency "bundler", "~> 1.11.2"

after this change the terminal accepted ./bin/console

----------------------
at the scraping coding point we had to add additional dependencies in daily_deal.gemspec at bottom
in addition we have to require 'nokogiri' and require 'pry' in the lib folder daily_deal.rb file to have the dependencies come through
------
to fix this error in daily_deal.gemspec
      The gemspec at /home/alex/code/daily_deal/daily_deal.gemspec is not valid. Please fix this gemspec.
      The validation error was '"FIXME" or "TODO" is not a description'
had to update the below summary and description with quoted content
--------------------
