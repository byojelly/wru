# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application. Created the ability for the user to interact with my program using simple terminal commands.
- [X] Pull data from an external source. CLI scrapes the Wales National Rugby Team Website for their upcoming matches.
- [X] Implement both list and detail views. Upon startup of cli the list is generated (schedule of upcoming matches). Directions are then given to the user to extract details for specific matches while also providing the ability to see other match details, to show the list again, or to exit the application.

# commit a lot. I will be graded on this.

# create a good README.md with a short description, install directions, contributers guide, and a link to the license for my repo.

#While you're working on it, record a 30 min coding session with your favorite screen capture tool. During the session, either think out loud or not. It's up to you. You don't need to submit the video, but we may ask for it at a later time.

#Make sure to check each box in your spec.md (replace the space between the square braces with an x) and explain next to each one how you've met the requirement before you submit your project.

#Prepare a video demo (narration helps!) describing how a user would interact with your working gem.

#Write a blog post about the project and process.

#On Learn, submit links to the GitHub repository for your app, your video demo, and your blog post each to the corresponding textbox in the right rail, and hit "I'm done" to wrap it up.
