#require & require_relative do the same thing in sligthly different ways
#require starts from the home directory to search for the file needed (takes longer to load than require_relative)
#require_relative is local, so you you need to go up one folder than down into the folder/file required
#above sets up a load dependency which requires a specific file

cli.call

#above this is assuming we have a CLI class written under DailyDeal, then operating the call method
